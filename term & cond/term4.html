        <h1>1. Accounts</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our Learning Management System (LMS). You need an account for most activities on our platform,
            including to purchase and access content or to submit content for publication. When setting up and
            maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information,
            including a valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that
            happens on your account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using
            your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not
            transfer your account to someone else or use someone else s account. If you contact us to request access to
            an account, we will not grant you such access unless you can provide us with the information that we need to
            prove you are the owner of that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will
            be closed.

        </p>

        <h1>2. Fees and Costs</h1>
        <p>You and grow4tech agree that each party will bear its own costs and attorneys  fees in the event of a dispute,
            provided, however, that either party may recover fees and costs to the extent permitted by applicable law.
            If a court or an arbitrator determines that an arbitration has been brought or threatened in bad faith, or
            that the demand was frivolous or asserted for an improper purpose, the court or arbitrator may, to the
            fullest extent permitted by law, award attorneys fees to the party defending against the claim just as a
            court could</p>

        <h1>3. Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access</h1>
        <p> when instructors publish content on grow4tech, they grant grow4tech a license to offer a license to the content to
            students. This means that we have the right to sublicense the content to enrolled students. As a student,
            when you enroll in a course or other content, whether its free or paid content, you are getting a license
            from grow4tech to view the content via the grow4tech platform and Services, and grow4tech is the licensor of record.
            Content is licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the content in
            any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the content
            and sharing it on torrent sites).</p>

        <h1>4.GROW4TECH Rights</h1>
        <p>All right, title, and interest in and to the grow4tech platform and Services, including our website, our existing
            or future applications, our APIs, databases, and the content our employees or partners submit or provide
            through our Services (but excluding content provided by instructors and students) are and will remain the
            exclusive property of grow4tech and its licensors. Our platforms and services are protected by copyright,
            trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Nothing gives you a right to use
            the grow4techy name or any of the grow4tech trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.
            Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding grow4tech or the Services is entirely voluntary
            and we will be free to use such feedback, comments, or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation
            to you.</p>

        <h1>5. Pricing</h1>
        <p>The prices of content on grow4tech are determined based on the terms of the Instructor Terms and our Promotions
            Policy. In some instances, the price of content offered on the grow4tech website may not be exactly the same as
            the price offered on our mobile or TV applications, due to mobile platform providers  pricing systems and
            their policies around implementing sales and promotions.

            We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during which certain content is available at
            discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to the content will be the price at the
            time you complete your purchase of the content (at checkout). Any price offered for particular content may
            also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who arent
            registered or logged in, because some of our promotions are available only to new users</p>

        <h1>6. Subscription Terms</h1>
        <p>This section covers additional terms that apply to your use of our subscription-based collections as a
            student (“Subscription Plans”). By using a Subscription Plan, you agree to the additional terms in this
            section. Note that use of grow4tech Business is not subject to these Terms, but is instead governed by the
            agreement between grow4tech and the subscribing organization</p>

        <h1>7. Free Trials & Renewals</h1>
        <p>Your subscription may start with a free trial. The duration of the free trial period of your subscription
            will be specified during sign-up. grow4tech determines free trial eligibility at our sole discretion and may
            limit access, eligibility, or duration. We reserve the right to terminate the free trial and suspend your
            subscription if we determine that you aren t eligible.

            We will charge the subscription fee for your next billing cycle at the end of the free trial period. Your

            unless you cancel your subscription prior to the end of the free trial period. For more information on how

            more than one year after the cause of action has accrued, except where this limitation cannot be imposed by
            law.

            Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given by registered or
            certified mail return receipt requested, or email (by us to the email associated with your account or by you
